\usage{
svar.signs(
  Y,
  p,
  nb.shocks,
  nb.periods.IRF = 20,
  bootstrap.replications = 1,
  confidence.interval = 0.9,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{Numeric matrix of size \eqn{T×n} containing the endogenous variables (one column per variable).
Column names are used for plot titles.}

\item{p}{Integer for the lag order.}

\item{nb.shocks}{Number shocks to be identified}

\item{nb.periods.IRF}{An integer specifying the number of periods for which
impulse response functions are computed. Default is 20.}

\item{bootstrap.replications}{An integer giving the number of bootstrap
replications used to compute confidence intervals. Applies only when a
parametric bootstrap is used. Default is 1 (no bootstrap).}

\item{confidence.interval}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 indicating the
confidence level for bootstrap intervals (e.g. 0.90 for 90% intervals).
Default is 0.90.}

\item{indic.plot}{Plots are displayed if = 1.}

\item{nb.draws}{Number of draws (number of random orthogonal
rotations that are generated in order to search for admissible IRFs).}

\item{horizon}{A list of length nb.shocks, where each element specifies the
time horizons (in periods) over which the corresponding sign restrictions
(given in sign.restrictions) must hold.}

\item{recursive}{Logical (0/1) . Determines whether the sign restrictions
are imposed in a recursive (sequential) manner or not.}

\item{SR.restrictions}{A list (optional) that specifies additional sign and
 zero restrictions on the impulse responses.
This argument is only used if both sign and zero restrictions are imposed
 together. If left empty (the default), only the restrictions given in
 `sign.restrictions` are applied.}

\item{sign.restriction}{A list of length nb.shocks, where each element is
  a matrix specifying the sign restrictions for one structural shock.
  - Each matrix must have dimension n × n (with n = number of endogenous variables).

  - The entry \eqn{[i, j]} corresponds to the restriction on the response of
    variable \eqn{i} to shock \eqn{j}.

  - Values should be:

 { 1: the response must be non-negative (≥ 0),}

{ -1: the response must be non-positive (≤ 0),}

{ 0: no restriction.}

  - Restrictions can be imposed at multiple horizons; see the companion
    horizon argument.}
}
\value{
A list with the following elements:

\describe{

  \item{xx}{Integer. The number of admissible rotations (i.e. draws from
  `nb.draws` that satisfied the sign and zero restrictions).}

  \item{IRFs.signs}{Array. The full set of admissible impulse response
  functions.}

  \item{simulated.IRFs}{Array. The collection of simulated IRFs obtained
  through bootstrap or direct simulation, before applying restrictions.}

  \item{all.CI.median}{median IRFs for the selected shocks. List of matrices.}

  \item{all.stdv.IRFs}{List of matrices. Each element corresponds to one
  shock.}

  \item{all.CI.lower.bounds}{List of matrices. Each element corresponds to
  one shock. Each matrix contains the lower quantile of the
  IRFs (according to `confidence.interval`).}

  \item{all.CI.upper.bounds}{List of matrices. Each element corresponds to
  one shock. Each matrix and contains the upper quantile of the
  IRFs (according to `confidence.interval`).}

}
}
\description{
Identifies structural shocks in a VAR(p) using sign restrictions (and
optionally zero restrictions), then computes impulse responses, potentially with confidence intervals using the
Uhlig (2005) and Arias et al. (2019) methodology. Inference is done according to Arias et al. (2009).
}
\details{
The routine first estimates a reduced-form VAR(p) for \code{Y} and obtains a
baseline Cholesky factorization to produce full IRFs for all shocks. It then
explores rotations of the impact matrix that preserve the reduced-form while
imposing user-supplied sign restrictions (and, if requested, zero restrictions).
Draws that satisfy all restrictions are kept; their IRFs form the admissible
set used for pointwise posterior/finite-sample summaries (median, percentile bands).

If \code{bootstrap.replications > 1}, reduced-form uncertainty is propagated
via a non-parametric residual bootstrap: the VAR is re-estimated on bootstrap
samples, IRFs are recomputed, and restrictions are re-applied for each
replication. If \code{bootstrap.replications == 1}, only the point estimate
(no bootstrap) is used.
